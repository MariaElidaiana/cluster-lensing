cluster-lensing
===========================
Welcome to the **cluster-lensing** documentation! Here you will find the
tools to calculate galaxy cluster halo properties and weak lensing
shear and magnification profiles. The model can easily include the
effects of possible cluster miscentering offsets, which would
otherwise lead to biased mass or concentration estimates.
